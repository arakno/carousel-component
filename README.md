# Component Exercise

This exercise makes use of snowpack for better development experience and less overhead on the artifacts.

#### 🎉 `Snowpack` + `lit-element` + `lit-html`

## 🚀 Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

Your app will be available at `localhost:8080`

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

## Rationale

Web components provide us with encapsulation and separation of concerns out of the box.
I have used no frameworks but chosen to include LitElement (and LitHtml) for improved developer experience and readability.
They also provide a baseline polyfill for browsers with poor support for custom elements.
